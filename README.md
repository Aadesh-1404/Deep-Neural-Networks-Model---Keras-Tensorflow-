# Deep-Neural-Networks-Model---Keras-Tensorflow-
Understood the basics of the deep neural networks. Build the DNN models FCNN, CNN and RESENT50 in keras & tensorflow. Tested the models built on the following datasets:
    > - From keras.datasets imported MNIST dataset which contains images of handwritten digits and has a training set of 60,000 examples, and a test set of 10,000 examples.
      - A three dense layered Fully Connected Neural Network model was build and the model was tested by this dataset.
    > - From keras.datasets imported CIFAR-10 dataset which contains colour images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class. There are 50000 training images and 10000 test             images.
      - A CNN model comrising of three convolutional layers and two dense layers was built and the CIFAR-10 dataset was tested on this model.
    > - RCNN
